# Newton's Interpolation (Divided Differences)

- Program tested on Python IDE (ie. Pycharm)
- Computes evaluation value using Newton's interpolation
- Takes in set of data points (datapoints.txt) in the following format:

    x0 x1 x2 ... xn

    y0 y1 y2 ... yn

# Input

- Prompts user to enter a value of x
- If user enters a 'Q' or 'q', the program will exit (output1.txt)
- If user enters a value that is not an int, an error message will be prompted and exit the program (output2.txt)

# Output

- Provides Newton's interpolation for divided differences; prompt iterates until user exits the program
