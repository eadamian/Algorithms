# Page Replacement Algorithms

- Page replacement algorithms and management through an operating system.
- Uses page frame sizes 3, 4, 5, and 6; measures number of page faults with each algorithm

# How to compile

- Standard compiling method: 
- javac Main.java
- java Main

# Output

- A file containing 50 randomly generated strings (ReferenceString.txt)
- A file that analyzes each of the 50 generated strings using each algorithm (Faults.txt)
- A file that analyzes the average performance (number of faults) of each algorithm based on page frame size (Average.txt)

- 4 files for FIFO algorithm (shows each step as an arraylist, displays total page faults)
- 4 files for LRU algorithm (shows each step as an arraylist, displays total page faults)
- 4 files for Optimal algorithm (shows each step as an arraylist, displays total page faults)
